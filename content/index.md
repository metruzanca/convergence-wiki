title: Unofficial & Open-Source Convergence mod Wiki
---
## Intro

As of 2024-01-06, the [Convergence Mod]() doesn't have a proper wiki yet. This project aims to fix that, by pooling notes together from:
- The [official Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zNRSMsUSGM)
- Taking notes from In-Game

## Get started

Check out some pages like: [[starting-classes/index|Starting Classes]], [[items/index|All Items]], [[items/weapons/index|Weapons]], [[items/spells/index|Spells]], [[items/armor/index|Armor Sets]], [[items/equipment/index|Equipment & Consumables]] or just use the search to find what you want.

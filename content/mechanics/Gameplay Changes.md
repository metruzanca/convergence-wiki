## Alternate Start

When you spawn, you start in the **Chapel of Anticipation** as usual but you'll be immediatly be able to pickup:

- Tarnished's Wizend Finger
- Whetstone Knife
- Flask of Wondrous Physick
- Crafting Kit

Upon exiting the Chapel via the "Wall of Light", you will be teleported to your starting class' spawn location.

### Crafting

You'll have access to all crafting recipes from the start, and can craft mid-combat.

You'll also automatically pickup materials when you approach them.


## Starting Classes

All classes have a new spawn location. In the location, the player can pick up two notes:

- Path of the <class_name>
- Weapons for the <class_name>

If they're a magic class, they'll also get a Faint Rune, which contains their first 4 class spells.

For magic classes, the Path note will explain how to get the other tiers of runes and are as follows.

- Tier 2: Shimmering
- Tier 3: Glowing
- Tier 4: Shining
- Tier 5: Radiant

> Tier 5 spell runes don't always contain 4. e.g. [[Dragon Cultist]] only has 2.

If you want to switch class, find the page about the class you want to swap to, and you can go grab the tiers 1 to 5.

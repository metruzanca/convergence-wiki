## Alternate Start

When you spawn, you start in the **Chapel of Anticipation** as usual but you'll be immediatly be able to pickup:

- Tarnished's Wizend Finger
- Whetstone Knife
- Flask of Wondrous Physick
- Crafting Kit

Upon exiting the Chapel via the "Wall of Light", you will be teleported to your starting class' spawn location.

### Crafting

%% Taken from [[1.0#Crafting Changes]] %%

All cookbooks are unlocked at the start of the game.

The requirement for Cracked Pots, Ritual Pots and Perfume Bottles has been removed. All craftable items can be crafted with the materials alone.

All crafted consumables have been changed to make Arcane the primary stat they scale with.

The item amount that is crafted of most consumables and ammunition has been increased each time you craft.

Glintstone Scraps, Large Glintstone Scraps, Explosive Stones, Explosive Stone Clumps, Poison Stones, Poison Stone Clumps, Gravity Stone Chunks and Gravity Stone Fans are now craftable.

You can craft mid-combat.

You'll also automatically pickup materials when you approach them.

## Starting Classes

All classes have a new spawn location. In the location, the player can pick up two notes:

- Path of the <class_name>
- Weapons for the <class_name>

If they're a magic class, they'll also get a Faint Rune, which contains their first 4 class spells.

For magic classes, the Path note will explain how to get the other tiers of runes and are as follows.

- Tier 2: Shimmering
- Tier 3: Glowing
- Tier 4: Shining
- Tier 5: Radiant

> Tier 5 spell runes don't always contain 4. e.g. [[Dragon Cultist]] only has 2.

If you want to switch class, find the page about the class you want to swap to, and you can go grab the tiers 1 to 5.

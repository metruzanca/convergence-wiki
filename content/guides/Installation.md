## Installation Instructions:
1. Download the Convergence downloader and run the downloader as administrator.
2. Point the download destination somewhere other than your game folder, like your desktop.
3. After it's done downloading and unpacking, navigate into the new `ConvergenceER` folder and double-click the `launchmod_eldenring.bat` file to play the mod.
(After you launch the mod, make sure you have ray tracing disabled. If the game did launch with ray tracing enabled, then disable it and close the game, then relaunch it.)

## A note about save files:

The mod uses a separate save file location so your vanilla characters will not be available by default. You can remove this feature by either moving or deleting theÂ `eldenring_alt_saves.dll` from the `ConvergenceER` folder. However, if you play the mod with vanilla characters, it will cause lots of bugs and general instability.

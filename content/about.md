> This wiki is unaffiliated with the team that created the mod and is entirely a fan project.

As of 2024-01-06, the [Convergence Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3419) doesn't have a wiki yet. This project aims to fix that. I don't expect anyone to use this, it may very well just end up being my own personal notes on the mod, however, if it can help someone else, awesome.

Information for the wiki has been derived from documents in [[References]] as well as from just playing the game and taking a lot of notes :).
